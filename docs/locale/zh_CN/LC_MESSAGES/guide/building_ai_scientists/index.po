"A customized AI scientist can be developed by integrating ToolUniverse "
"with LLMs, reasoning models, and AI agents. In this configuration, the "
"LLMs and reasoning models provide the core capabilities for reasoning and"
" tool usage, while ToolUniverse serves as the scientific environment for "
"interaction and experimentation."

"Once the setup is complete, the AI scientist operates as follows: given a"
" user instruction or task, it formulates a plan or hypothesis, employs "
"the tool finder in ToolUniverse to identify relevant tools, and "
"iteratively applies these tools to gather information, conduct "
"experiments, verify hypotheses, and request human feedback when "
"necessary. For each required tool call, the AI scientist generates "
"arguments that conform to the ToolUniverse protocol, after which "
"ToolUniverse executes the tool and returns the results for further "
"reasoning."
