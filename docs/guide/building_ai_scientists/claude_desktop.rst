Prerequisites
-------------

Before setting up Claude Desktop integration, ensure you have:

- **Claude Desktop App**: Installed and running on your system
- **UV Package Manager**: For running the MCP server

Installation and Setup
----------------------

Step 1: Install ToolUniverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ToolUniverse using pip (uv is recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install tooluniverse

Verify installation:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import tooluniverse; print('ToolUniverse installed successfully')"

Step 2: Locate Claude Desktop Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Claude Desktop App and navigate to the configuration:

1. **Open Claude Desktop App**
2. **Go to Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**
3. **Note the configuration file location** (typically in your user directory)

The configuration file will be opened in your default text editor.

Step 3: Configure ToolUniverse MCP Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the ToolUniverse MCP server configuration to your Claude Desktop config:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tooluniverse": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/your/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-studio"
         ]
       }
     }
   }

**Important Configuration Notes**:

- Replace `/path/to/your/uv/environment` with your actual uv environment
- Use absolute paths for better reliability

**Example Configuration**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tooluniverse": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/Users/username/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-studio"
         ]
       }
     }
   }

Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After saving the configuration:

1. **Completely quit Claude Desktop App**
2. **Restart Claude Desktop App**
3. **Verify the MCP server is loaded** (check the developer console if needed)

Tool Selection Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Selective Tool Loading**:
- Load only relevant tools for specific research domains
- Reduce context window usage
- Improve response times

**Example Tool Selection**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tooluniverse": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-stdio",
           "--tools",
           "drug_discovery,genomics,literature"
         ]
       }
     }
   }

**Custom Tool Sets**

Create custom tool sets for specific research domains:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tooluniverse-drug-discovery": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-stdio",
           "--toolset",
           "drug_discovery"
         ]
       },
       "tooluniverse-genomics": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-studio",
           "--toolset",
           "genomics"
         ]
       }
     }
   }

Multiple MCP Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run multiple ToolUniverse instances for different purposes:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tooluniverse-research": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-studio",
           "--mode",
           "research"
         ]
       },
       "tooluniverse-analysis": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/uv/environment",
           "run",
           "tooluniverse-mcp-studio",
